<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to our Birth Fund!</h3>

<p>Together, Brian and I have lived a very simple, cost-efficient, and healthy life. We are very intentional about how we spend our money and time.</p>

<p>Our decision to birth our son at home was made with the hope and faith that we can begin this journey in an empowering, affirming space without unnecessary interventions. A healthy woman having vaginal birth is the most natural thing that can take place on the face of the planet. I am so thankful that our baby and I are healthy enough to be candidates for a natural home birth. Ultimately, we have taken all the steps to ensure that we are mindfully prepared to receive this gift from God and the universe.</p>

<h4>Midwife</h4>
<p>After interviewing several midwives, we found it easy to pick Shannon Staloch, who is a Certified Professional Midwife (CPM) and Board Certified Lactation Consultant. She brings the most wholesome, positive energy and is extremely passionate about cultivating a natural, welcoming, safe environment for all three of us. 

In case, you want to learn more about home births, we encourage you to visit her <a href="http://homemadefamilies.com/2013/08/27/home-birth-faqs">website</a>.</p>

<h4>Doula</h4>
<p>Lenore Palumbo, we found through a birth center. We had instant chemistry with her specifically because of her expertise in nutrition. On top of being a certified doula, she is a nutritional therapist and speaks Spanish :) </p>
